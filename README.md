# Rest API
Made by Made by Ninon Vrignaud and Simon Duval for CS 8803-MAS.
## Repository presentation

This repository contains the code to launch our common REST API.
We based our implementation on the [firebase4j](https://github.com/bane73/firebase4j) library which provides an interface to the Google firebase REST API in java.

## What we added

We used the functions provided by the library to create the packages "Controller", "

## How to run
* Download this repository
* This is a maven project, so you should have maven installed
* Run the main function in src/.../Controller.java

Add keys to config file...

This will launch the webservice at localhost:8080.
